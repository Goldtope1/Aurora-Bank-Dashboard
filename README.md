## Aurora Bank Insights Dashboard

### Introduction

#### Project Overview
---
Welcome to the Aurora Bank Insights Dashboard! This project is an in-depth analysis aimed at uncovering critical insights from financial data on customers, transactions, cards, and merchant categories. By leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization techniques, the dashboard provides actionable insights to drive informed decision-making at Aurora Bank.

#### Objective

**The primary goals of this project include:**

- Gaining a deep understanding of customer demographics and financial behaviours.

- Identifying potential risks such as rising debt and fraudulent activities.

- Uncovering patterns and trends in customer transactions to enhance engagement strategies.

- Delivering these insights through a visually impactful and interactive dashboard created in Power BI.

**Dataset Summary**

The dataset contains information across multiple key areas:

- Customer Data: Demographics such as age, gender, and income bands.

- Credit Score Data: Credit score ranges and associated risk levels.

- Transaction Data: Spending patterns, merchant categories, and error types.

- Card Ownership Data: Credit and debit card usage trends segmented by demographic and risk levels.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
---

Data preprocessing was a crucial step to ensure the reliability of the analysis. The key steps included:

- Handling Missing Values: Missing values were imputed or removed to maintain data integrity.

- Outlier Detection and Removal: Extreme values in transactions and DTI ratios were flagged and treated to avoid skewing results.

- **Data Transformation**: Created new features such as debt-to-income ratios and categorized income bands to enhance analysis.

- Normalization: Ensured consistent data formats for variables like income, transaction amounts, and age.

- Error Analysis: Identified and categorized transaction errors (e.g., insufficient balances, bad PINs) for deeper insights.

**Data Modeling**
---

The data was segmented into key analytical models:

- **Customer Profiling and Segmentation**: Used demographic data to classify customers into risk and engagement categories.

- **Credit Risk Analysis**: Modeled relationships between debt-to-income ratios, credit scores, and customer risk levels.

- **Spending Trend Analysis**: Evaluated transaction volumes and patterns by merchant categories and age groups.

- **Error Trend Monitoring**: Analyzed the frequency and distribution of transaction errors.

These models formed the foundation for the dynamic Power BI dashboard, allowing stakeholders to explore insights interactively.

### Interpretation of Results
---

**Actionable Insights**

***Debt-to-Income Analysis***:

- High-income groups exhibit lower debt-to-income ratios, indicating lower financial stress.

- Age groups 25-34 and 35-49 show higher debt burdens, signalling potential areas for targeted financial planning services.

***Credit Score Trends***:

- Customers with lower credit scores often have higher debt-to-income ratios, aligning with increased risk.

- Risk mitigation strategies can focus on customers with scores between 580 and 670.

***Transaction Patterns:***

- The majority of transactions occur in grocery stores and money transfers, suggesting opportunities for tailored rewards programs.

- High-value transactions flagged as outliers could indicate potential fraud or VIP customer activity.

***Error Analysis:***

- Insufficient balances are the most frequent error, highlighting the need for better customer notifications or overdraft protection services.

### Conclusion
---

This project demonstrates the power of data analytics in transforming raw financial data into actionable business insights. By understanding customer profiles, spending behaviours, and risk levels, Aurora Bank can implement strategies to enhance customer engagement, improve risk management, and optimize overall business performance.
